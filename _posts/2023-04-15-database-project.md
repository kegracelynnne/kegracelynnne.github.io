•	Developed a database-backed website using Django.
•	Included the Book, BookInstance, and Author models. Explored the LocalLibrary administration web site that allows us to create, read, update, and delete data in our database. Created views for home page display the LocalLibrary application with list of books, and views for detail page to display book information. Add pagination so that there are 20 books shows in a page. (Next thing to add: Use sessions to improve your interaction with anonymous users, e.g. counting the visitors.)
