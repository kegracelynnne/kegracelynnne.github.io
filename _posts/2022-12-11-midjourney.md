•	Report about this project: `Text-Image Pair Generation via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models` <a href="../assets/reports/eecs595_finalreport.pdf" target="_blank"> (Read More) </a> published in <a href="https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/teaching/eecs595_fa22/" target="_blank">EECS595 Fall22 Class Projects Gallery</a>

 

•	In this project, we want to explore about the text2image for the recent popular art AI generator Midjourney AI, and utilize sota vision-language models such as mPlUG and OFA to train on the dataset we created using Midjourney AI, and analyse and compare the performance of these two models.
